Analysis of factors affecting car prices using multiple linear regression
# Car Price Regression Analysis

## Business Question
What factors drive car prices, and how do technology (EV/Hybrid) and brand influence MSRP?

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Car Features and MSRP Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset/data)
- Size: ~7,900 observations
- Variables: Engine HP, Cylinders, Fuel Type, Brand, MSRP, etc.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (log(MSRP), dummy variables)
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Hypothesis testing and residual analysis

## Key Insights
- Electric vehicles are priced significantly higher after controlling for technical factors
- Brand contributes additional explanatory power to price differences
- Technology factors explain most of the price variance compared to branding

## Tools
Python (pandas, statsmodels), Jupyter Notebook
